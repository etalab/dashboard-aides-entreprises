## Introduction

The back office is a major feature of Apiviz. It allows you to completely customize your website online, from top to bottom. Still, configuring a website is a hard task given the number of variables it implies : footer, navbar, data, and so on...

So we tried to simplify this task by organizing the things to customize in specific families, all accessible and editable from a single back-office space.

{% include figure image_path="/documentation/screenshots/backoffice-sonum-06.png" alt="backoffice view" %}

The back office is organized as follow : 

- A - a side menu to access all the configuration's collections ; 
- B - a tab menu for each collection, to access every sub-family of configuration ; 
- C - a configuration documents list for every tab ; 

Then for every document you can : 

- D - open an editor to modify the entries ; 
- E - duplicate the document (if the "`add document`" button is present at the end of the documents list) ; 
- F - delete the document (if the "`delete`" button appears at the end of the document's editor) ;
